# Retro Portfolio Site

This repository contains a simple React project built with Vite. It features a rotating globe styled with a retro vibe and playful pixel fonts. The globe uses emoji icons for the skyscraper, sailboat, and camping cabin so no binary images are required. Hovering the icons reveals labels, and the boat gently rocks on the ocean.

## Running Locally

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The output in `app/dist` can be deployed to services like Cloudflare Pages.
