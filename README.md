# Retro Portfolio Site

This repository contains a simple React project built with Vite. It features a rotating globe styled with a retro vibe. The globe uses emoji icons for the skyscraper, sailboat, and camping cabin so no binary images are required.

## Running Locally

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The output in `app/dist` can be deployed to services like Cloudflare Pages.
